<div class="About Us">  <div class="container">    <h1>About Captain Cornhole</h1>      <p>Captain Cornhole is a family owned and operated business. We build our custom boards in sunny Southern California in the city of Orange. Our mission is to create custom top-quality, regulation size Cornhole boards at an affordable price.      We take pride hand picking every piece of lumber and cabinet grade plywood for our boards. Each board is carefully put together and sanded numerous times during finishing to ensure a smooth, glossy and quality finished product. We make sure that every board we sell is not only beautifully made but will last you a lifetime.      We have numerous options when picking your set.</p>      <%= image_tag('Americanflag.JPG', width: '300', height: '200', class: 'photo') %>            <p>We offer a very basic set that is put together and sanded with no finish if your looking to add a decal or are feeling creative yourself.</p>      <p>Our next board is sanded to perfection and is stained in your choice of light, medium or dark stain and sealed for that perfect rustic wood look.</p>      <p>One of our most popular sets is striped boards that are sanded and stained in a striped pattern and sealed with a glossy finish for a really neat look that showcases the beauty of our hand picked top quality plywood.</p>      <p>Another popular choice is one striped board with the other board in our rustic finish with hand stamped stars. This is our “American Flag” set.</p>          <%= image_tag('Rustic.JPG', width: '300', height: '200', class: 'photo') %>      <p>Of course we do custom! Our custom option allows you to communicate with us your vision and we enjoy the process of making a set of boards that is uniquely you. Please feel free to reach out to customize your set today!</p>      <p>We specialize in enhancing the natural wood grain of the boards that we hand select. Please keep in mind that we are wood workers not artists. We have many custom options for your boards but do not specialize in hand painting our boards as we feel that it takes away from the natural beauty of the high quality wood.</p>        <%= image_tag('Stripeswoody.JPG', width: '300', height: '200', class: 'photo') %>   <%= image_tag('stripes.JPG', width: '300', height: '200', class: 'photo') %>      <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit Captain Cornhole.
